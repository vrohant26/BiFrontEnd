              Brands and companies tend to grow through increasing the depth of
              the offering, venturing in new markets or benefits territory, and

              <br></br>
              This can result in a sub-optimal brand portfolio architecture:
              driving confusion in customers, weakening the brand, hindering the
              positioning of breakthrough innovations, highlighting divisions
              and silos to external stakeholders.<br></br>
              <br></br> Our Brand Architecture service is designed to uncover
              opportunities and recommend the best strategy(es) to drastically
              improve the naming architecture of the portfolio, to a:
